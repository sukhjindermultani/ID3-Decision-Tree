# ID3-Decision-Tree

#All programs are written in python. The programs have already been executed and the output has been stored, so they can be run in any order.
#$python id3_create.py    --> Creates the decision tree
#$python id3_predict.py   --> Tests both datasets with the created decision tree.
#$python id3_prune.py     --> prunes the decision tree. Running id3_predict.py will then display results with this pruned tree.
